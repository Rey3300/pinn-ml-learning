#PINN-ML-Learning
# PINN Learning Journey

My 10-week structured learning path to master physics-informed neural networks 
for computational finance.

**Start Date:** February 3, 2026  
**Goal:** Be prepared to start independent research on barrier option pricing

## Learning Objectives

By the end of 10 weeks, I will be able to:
- [ ] Implement stochastic processes (Brownian motion, GBM)
- [ ] Derive and code Black-Scholes equation
- [ ] Build neural networks in PyTorch
- [ ] Compute second-order derivatives with autograd
- [ ] Implement physics-informed neural networks
- [ ] Price options using multiple methods (analytical, MC, PINN)

## Weekly Progress

### Week 1: Python Fundamentals + Probability ✓
- NumPy array operations
- Matplotlib visualization
- Normal and log-normal distributions
- Basic probability simulations

### Week 2: [Not Started]
